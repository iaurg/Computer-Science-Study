## Resume

Computer are only 0 and 1. On/Off, True/False, 0/1, like a eletricity plug. Because in the end is all about eletricity.

Every character in a binary is a _bit_, a group of 8 bit is a byte 8bit = 1byte.

How computer differ binary 01000001(65) to show number 65 integer or 'A' character?
R: The compiler or interpreter "say" to computer which one to use. Your program define the rules, like something:

```c
int x = 65;
char c = 'a';
```

In binary both are 01000001, but the C compiler define one like int and another like char.

Characters are translated from binary using de [UNICODE](https://home.unicode.org) pattern.

Computer works in this way:
INPUT -> ALGORITHMS -> OUTPUT

_functions_ are equal actions you ask computer to do
_if, else, elseif..._ are conditions to change

The big point of good functions is to divide and conquer the problem, less steps. Even try to less repeat (DRY), to good abstractions and advance in baby steps.

SOURCE CODE -> COMPILER -> MACHINE CODE (0010)
