# Artificial Intelligence

Some kind of inteligence provided to computers

Suggestions and auto selections can be made by a AI

A lot of decision making

Decision trees: a tree with a bunch decision tha computer can flow

Optimal decision making

Minimax: Some concept used in AI to know "weights" of each values and make a decision based on that

Depth Limite Minimax: Calculate a limited number of next possible options

Depth First Search: Try between options and go randomly in a direction until hit the final target

Breath-First Search: Pickup many options and advance a little bit in each one

Informed Serach: Search strategy that uses problem special knowledge to find solutions more efficiently

Greedy Best-First Search: Calculate manhtan distance for each value and make decisions based on that

A* Search: Work with more information to find result, some like grab each value and remembering steps

## Machine Learning

- Reinforcement Learning: Computer make good and bad decisions retaining results and trying again with better ones.

Is always good to an AI to balance between explore and exploit

Genetic Algotrithms: Create and generate random itens eliminating not sucessful one and repeat the process with good ones
